# Getting Started

Welcome to our Study Compass! This section will guide you through setting up and starting our application, which uses React for the frontend and Express for the backend. We utilize Concurrently to run both parts simultaneously, streamlining the development process.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (at least version 12.x)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running **`node -v`** and **`npm -v`** in your terminal.
If Node is not installed, you can find the installation link [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).

On Mac, you can install node from the terminal with

```bash
brew install node@20
```
