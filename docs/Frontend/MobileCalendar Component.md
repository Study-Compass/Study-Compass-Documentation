## **Overview**

**`MobileCalendar`** is a React component designed specifically for mobile devices to display and interact with a weekly calendar. It extends the functionality of the **`Calendar`** component into a mobile-friendly format, utilizing a swiping gesture for navigation between days of the week and animated transitions for showing or hiding the calendar. It integrates the **`Swiper`** component for smooth, touch-enabled sliding between days.

Refer to the Calendar component for functionality (linked below), can be functionally treated the same (props and functions are exactly the same). Key differences include no support for drag searching (selecting time queries), and an implementation of the calendar as a swiper between days for ease of use on mobile.
